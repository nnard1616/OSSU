# OSSU
My completed assignments and projects for courses listed under the Open Source Society University's curriculum for a self-taught Computer Science "Degree".  Completing the curriculum bestows upon the individual knowledge and skills that would be on par with recent CS college graduates.

Curriculum can be found here: https://github.com/ossu/computer-science
